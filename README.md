# Swiftel Fibre Website

This is the official marketing and informational website for Swiftel Fibre, a modern Internet Service Provider (ISP). The site is built as a high-performance, static-first website using the Astro framework with interactive Svelte "islands."

## âœ¨ Features

* **Astro Islands Architecture:** The site is static HTML by default for extreme performance, with interactive Svelte components hydrated only on the client as needed.
* **Dual-Theme Support:** A complete light/dark mode system (with a neutral dark theme for logo contrast), with the user's preference saved to `localStorage`.
* **Fully Responsive:** A mobile-first design that scales perfectly from small phones to large desktops.
* **Interactive Package Showcase:**
    * A dynamic toggle to switch between "Home" and "Business" plans.
    * Expandable package cards to show detailed features without cluttering the UI.
    * A horizontal-scrolling carousel on mobile with a custom "dot" pagination indicator.
* **Interactive Navigation:** A full-screen, animated hamburger menu for mobile devices, complete with a theme toggle.
* **Content-Driven "Learn" Hub:** A "hub-and-spoke" model for articles. The hub page (`/learn`) features article cards, and the articles themselves are written in simple Markdown (`.md`).
* **Custom Pages:** Includes a themed "About Us" page with a custom-styled timeline and a "404 Not Found" page with a creative, brand-colored "glitch" effect.
* **Brand-First Design:** Uses a code-based, theme-aware SVG logo system for perfect clarity and scalability across the site.
