# What is a Hotspot?

A **Wi-Fi hotspot** is a physical location where you can connect to the internet wirelessly. It works by broadcasting a signal from a router or access point, allowing nearby devices to go online without needing cables or a home connection.

You may be familiar with using your phone as a personal hotspot — but public hotspots are different. They’re designed to serve multiple users in a shared space, like a café, campus, or neighborhood.

## Swiftel Fibre’s Hotspot Solution

Swiftel Fibre offers a unique hotspot service tailored for flexibility and affordability. It’s perfect for students, visitors, and anyone who needs high-speed internet without a monthly contract.

### How It Works

1. **Connect to the Network**  
   Look for the “Swiftel Hotspot” Wi-Fi signal on your phone, laptop, or tablet.

2. **Access the Portal**  
   Once connected, your browser will automatically open our secure login portal. If it doesn’t, just visit any website (like `google.com`) and you’ll be redirected.

3. **Choose Your Plan**  
   Select from hourly, daily, or weekly access — all prepaid and affordable.

4. **Pay Securely**  
   Use mobile money services like **M-Pesa** to complete your payment instantly.

5. **Start Browsing**  
   Once confirmed, your device is connected to Swiftel’s fibre-powered internet.

- **Local Coverage:** Available in select areas across Kasarani and Njiru.
