# What is a Hotspot?

A Wi-Fi hotspot is a physical location where you can access the internet, typically using Wi-Fi, via a wireless local area network (WLAN) with a router connected to an internet service provider.

While you're familiar with using your phone as a "personal hotspot," a **public Wi-Fi hotspot** is a service, like the one offered by Swiftel Fibre, that provides high-speed internet to customers in a specific area.

## The Swiftel Fibre Hotspot Solution

Our hotspot solution is designed for maximum flexibility, breaking away from the traditional monthly bill. It's perfect for students, visitors, or anyone who wants high-speed internet without a long-term contract.

### How It Works

1.  **Connect:** In an area covered by a Swiftel Fibre Hotspot, you simply connect to the "Swiftel Hotspot" Wi-Fi network on your phone, laptop, or tablet.
2.  **Access the Portal:** Once connected, your device's browser will automatically open our secure portal. If it doesn't, just try to visit any website (like `google.com`) and you will be redirected.
3.  **Choose Your Plan:** From the portal, you can purchase internet access for just the time you need. We offer flexible plans, from one hour to a full day or week.
4.  **Pay & Browse:** You can pay directly and securely through the portal using mobile money services like M-Pesa. Once your payment is confirmed, your device is instantly connected to our high-speed fibre internet.

This "pay-as-you-go" model means you only pay for the internet you actually use, making it an affordable and convenient way to stay connected.
