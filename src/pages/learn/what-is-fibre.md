# What is Fibre Internet?

Fibre-optic internet is the fastest, most reliable way to connect to the web — and it’s changing how we stream, work, and communicate. Unlike older technologies like DSL or cable, fibre uses light to transmit data, delivering speeds that feel instant and uninterrupted.

## How Does Fibre Work?

Traditional internet relies on copper wires that transmit electrical signals. These signals degrade over distance and are vulnerable to interference from nearby electronics.

Fibre internet is different. It uses ultra-thin strands of glass — each about the width of a human hair — to send data as pulses of light.

### Why Light Beats Electricity

- **Speed of Light:** Data travels nearly 300,000 km/s.
- **Minimal Signal Loss:** Fibre maintains strength over long distances.
- **No Interference:** Light signals aren’t affected by electromagnetic noise.

This means you get a stable, high-speed connection even during peak hours or bad weather.

## The Power of Symmetrical Speeds

Most older connections are **asymmetrical** — fast downloads but painfully slow uploads. Fibre is **symmetrical**, meaning you get the same speed in both directions.

| Activity | Needs Download | Needs Upload |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Streaming (Netflix, YouTube) | ✅ | |
| Video Calls (Zoom, Teams) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Online Gaming | ✅ | ✅ |
| Uploading Files | | ✅ |
| Live Streaming | | ✅ |
| Smart Home Devices | | ✅ |

With symmetrical speeds, your video calls are crisp, your uploads are fast, and your smart devices stay responsive.

## Why Fibre Is Future-Proof

Fibre isn’t just fast — it’s scalable. As technology evolves, fibre can handle higher speeds without needing to replace the cables. It’s the backbone of smart homes, cloud computing, and next-gen entertainment.
