# What is Fibre Internet?

You’ve heard the term "fibre," but what does it actually mean? In simple terms, fibre-optic internet is the fastest and most reliable type of internet connection available today. It’s a true game-changer compared to older technologies like DSL or cable.

## How Does It Work?

Traditional internet (like cable or DSL) runs on copper wires, the same kind of wires used for a landline phone for decades. It sends electrical signals, which are slow and degrade over long distances.

**Fibre internet is completely different.**

It uses a technology called "fibre optics," which are tiny, flexible strands of glass, each about the thickness of a human hair. Instead of electricity, it transmits data as pulses of **light**.

* **Speed of Light:** Data travels at nearly the speed of light.
* **Less Interference:** Light signals aren't affected by electromagnetic interference like copper wires are.
* **Less Signal Loss:** The signal remains strong over massive distances.

This means you get an incredibly fast, stable, and consistent connection that isn't shared with your neighbors or affected by bad weather.

## The Biggest Advantage: Symmetrical Speeds

This is the most important feature for modern internet use.

* **"Asymmetrical" (Old Tech):** Cable and DSL internet almost always have a very fast **download** speed but a very slow **upload** speed (e.g., 50 Mbps down, 5 Mbps up). This was fine when we only consumed content.
* **"Symmetrical" (Fibre Tech):** Fibre gives you the same speed in *both* directions. If you have a 50 Mbps plan, you get **50 Mbps download AND 50 Mbps upload**.

### Why Symmetrical Speed Matters

In the age of working from home, video calls, and content creation, your upload speed is just as important as your download speed.

| Activity | Relies on Download | Relies on Upload |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Streaming** (Netflix, YouTube) | ✅ | |
| **Browsing** Websites | ✅ | |
| **Downloading** Files | ✅ | |
| **Video Calls** (Zoom, Teams) | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Online Gaming** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Uploading** Files (Google Drive, etc.) | | ✅ |
| **Live Streaming** (TikTok, Twitch) | | ✅ |
| **Smart Home Devices** (Security Cams) | | ✅ |

With a slow upload speed, your video calls will be choppy, your games will lag, and sending large files will take forever. Fibre solves all of this.
