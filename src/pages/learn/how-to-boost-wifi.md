# How to Boost Your Wi-Fi Signal

Even with a high-speed fibre connection, a poor Wi-Fi setup can slow you down. If you're experiencing lag, buffering, or "dead zones" in your home, here are the most effective ways to improve your wireless signal.

## 1. The Golden Rule: Location, Location, Location

Your router's physical position is the single most important factor for good Wi-Fi.

* **Move it to the Center:** Place your router as close to the center of your home as possible.
* **Keep it Open:** Don't hide your router in a cabinet, a closet, or behind the TV. Wi-Fi signals need open air to travel.
* **Get it High Up:** Place it on a high shelf or mount it on a wall. Signals radiate outwards and downwards, so a higher position provides better coverage.
* **Avoid Interference:** Keep it away from other electronics, especially microwave ovens, cordless phone bases, and large metal objects (like a refrigerator or filing cabinet), which can block or interfere with the signal.

## 2. Point Your Antennas (If You Have Them)

If your router has external antennas, don't point them all straight up.
* **For a single-story home:** Position one antenna vertically (up) and the other horizontally (sideways). This helps the router send signals that can be easily picked up by devices whether they are held upright (like a phone) or flat (like a laptop).
* **For a multi-story home:** Point the antennas for the main floor sideways and aim the antennas for other floors at an angle (e.g., 45 degrees) to broadcast up or down.

## 3. Use a Wi-Fi Extender or Mesh System

Sometimes, one router just isn't enough to cover a large or complex home.

* **Wi-Fi Extender:** This is a small device that picks up your existing signal, repeats it, and extends its reach. It's a good, simple solution for solving one or two specific dead zones (like a back bedroom).
* **Mesh System:** This is a more advanced solution. It replaces your router with multiple "nodes" that you place around your home. They all work together to create one seamless, powerful Wi-Fi network. This is the best solution for large or multi-story homes and ensures you have a strong signal everywhere.

## 4. Check for a Modern Router

If your router is more than 4-5 years old, it might be the bottleneck. Newer standards like **Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)** are much faster, more efficient at handling many devices at once, and better at penetrating walls. An older router simply can't deliver the full speeds that your fibre connection provides.
