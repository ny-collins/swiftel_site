# How to Boost Your Wi-Fi Signal

Even with high-speed fibre, poor Wi-Fi setup can ruin your experience. If you're facing lag, buffering, or dead zones, this guide will help you unlock the full potential of your wireless network.

## Quick Checklist

- ✅ Place router at the center of your home
- ✅ Elevate router on a shelf or wall
- ✅ Avoid hiding it in cabinets or behind electronics
- ✅ Use mesh systems for large homes
- ✅ Upgrade to a modern router (Wi-Fi 6 or newer)

## 1. Location Is Everything

Your router’s position is the single biggest factor in Wi-Fi performance.

- **Center It:** Place your router near the middle of your home for even coverage.
- **Keep It Visible:** Avoid hiding it in cabinets or behind TVs — Wi-Fi needs open space.
- **Elevate It:** Mount it on a wall or place it on a high shelf. Signals radiate outward and downward.
- **Avoid Interference:** Keep it away from microwaves, cordless phones, and large metal objects.

## 2. Angle Your Antennas (If You Have Them)

External antennas aren’t just for show — they shape your signal.

- **Single-story homes:** One antenna vertical, one horizontal.
- **Multi-story homes:** Tilt antennas at 45° to reach upper or lower floors.

## 3. Use a Wi-Fi Extender or Mesh System

If your home is large or has thick walls, one router may not be enough.

| Solution | Best For | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wi-Fi Extender** | Small dead zones | Affordable, easy setup | Creates separate network, slower speeds |
| **Mesh System** | Large/multi-story homes | Seamless coverage, single network | Higher cost, replaces your router |

Mesh systems like TP-Link Deco or Google Nest Wi-Fi are ideal for uninterrupted coverage.

## 4. Upgrade Your Router

If your router is over 4–5 years old, it may be holding you back.

- **Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax):** Faster speeds, better range, handles more devices.
- **Dual-band or tri-band:** Reduces congestion and improves performance.
- **Beamforming & MU-MIMO:** Directs signal to devices and supports simultaneous connections.

## 5. Secure Your Network

A slow network might be caused by unauthorized users.

- Use a strong password (WPA2 or WPA3 encryption).
- Disable WPS and remote access if not needed.
- Regularly check connected devices via your router’s admin panel.
