# Mbps vs. Gbps: Understanding Speed

When you shop for internet, you see terms like "Mbps" and "Gbps." But what do they actually mean, and how much speed do you really need?

## The Basics: What is a "Bit"?

All digital data is made of **bits**, which are tiny pieces of information. A **megabit (Mb)** is one million bits. A **gigabit (Gb)** is one *billion* bits.

* **Mbps (Megabits per second):** How many *millions* of bits can be downloaded or uploaded every second.
* **Gbps (Gigabits per second):** How many *billions* of bits can be downloaded or uploaded every second.

Simply put, **1 Gbps is 1,000 times faster than 1 Mbps.**

## How Much Speed Do You Really Need?

The speed you need depends entirely on what you do online and how many people (and devices) are using the internet at the same time.

Here are some common activities and their *approximate* required download speeds:

| Activity | Recommended Minimum Speed (per device) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Email & Web Browsing** | 1 - 5 Mbps |
| **Social Media** | 5 Mbps |
| **Music Streaming (Spotify)** | 2 Mbps |
| **Video Streaming (SD 480p)** | 3 - 5 Mbps |
| **Video Streaming (HD 1080p)** | 10 - 15 Mbps |
| **Video Streaming (4K UHD)** | 25 - 40 Mbps |
| **Video Calls (Zoom/Teams)** | 2 - 4 Mbps (Upload/Download) |
| **Online Gaming (Lag-free)** | 5 - 10 Mbps (Upload/Download) |

### The "Household" Factor

The numbers above are *per device*. If you have multiple people in your home, you have to add them up.

* **Example:** One person watching 4K Netflix (25 Mbps) + another person on a Zoom call (4 Mbps) + a third person gaming (10 Mbps) = **you're already using 39 Mbps at the same time.**

This is why our **Home Advanced (23 Mbps)** and **Home Premium (33 Mbps)** plans are so popular. They provide enough bandwidth for a modern family to stream, work, and game simultaneously without buffering or lag. For power users, our **Ultra** and **Elite** plans offer a virtually unlimited experience.
