# Mbps vs Gbps: Understanding Internet Speed

When shopping for internet, you’ll often see terms like **Mbps** and **Gbps**. But what do they actually mean — and how much speed do you really need?

This guide breaks it down in plain language, so you can choose the right plan for your lifestyle.

## What Is a Bit?

All digital data — videos, emails, websites — is made up of **bits**, the smallest unit of information.

- **1 Megabit (Mb)** = 1 million bits  
- **1 Gigabit (Gb)** = 1 billion bits  
- **1 Byte** = 8 bits (used for file sizes like MB or GB)

So when your internet speed is listed as **100 Mbps**, it means your connection can transfer 100 million bits per second — or about 12.5 megabytes per second.

## Mbps vs Gbps

| Unit | Meaning | Speed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mbps** | Megabits per second | Millions of bits per second |
| **Gbps** | Gigabits per second | Billions of bits per second |
| **1 Gbps** | = 1,000 Mbps | Ultra-fast |

Most home users will see speeds in Mbps, while businesses or power users may opt for Gbps plans.

## How Much Speed Do You Need?

It depends on how many people and devices are using your connection — and what they’re doing.

| Activity | Recommended Speed (per device) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Browsing & Email | 1–5 Mbps |
| Social Media | 5 Mbps |
| Music Streaming | 2 Mbps |
| Video Streaming (SD) | 3–5 Mbps |
| Video Streaming (HD 1080p) | 10–15 Mbps |
| Video Streaming (4K UHD) | 25–40 Mbps |
| Video Calls (Zoom/Teams) | 2–4 Mbps (both up & down) |
| Online Gaming | 5–10 Mbps (both up & down) |

### Example: A Family of 4

- 1 person watching 4K Netflix (25 Mbps)  
- 1 person on a Zoom call (4 Mbps)  
- 1 person gaming online (10 Mbps)  
- 1 person browsing and streaming music (5 Mbps)  

**Total needed: ~44 Mbps**

That’s why Swiftel’s [Home Advanced (23 Mbps)](/packages) and [Home Premium (33 Mbps)](/packages) plans are so popular — they’re designed for real-world usage. For larger households or content creators, our **Ultra** and **Elite** plans offer even more headroom.

## Upload Speed Matters Too

Most people focus on download speed — but **upload speed** is just as important for:

- Video calls
- Uploading files to the cloud
- Online gaming
- Live streaming
- Smart home devices (like security cameras)

With [fibre internet](/learn/what-is-fibre), you get **symmetrical speeds** — meaning your upload and download speeds are equal. That’s a game-changer for remote work, content creation, and real-time communication.
